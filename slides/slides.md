everything that is **written** about the Son of Man <br>
by the **prophets** will be accomplished....

>>>
+ Abused, **killed**, rise on third day
  + Disciples, even as **helped fulfill** prophecy, misund
+ Theme mid-Luke: misunderst **kingdom** of God, Messiah
+ Jesus was a man well-acquainted with **sorrows**
  + v41-44 **wept** over Jerusalem
  + her failure to **recognize** her day of redemption
  + He **knew** the suffering He was about to go through
+ Jesus is the **victorious** conquerer, strong to **save**
  + **how** He did it was by **humbling** Himself
+ in **obedience** to Father's plan, **sacrifice** for sins
+ If this is how my **Master** and **Shepherd** walked,
  + will I **choose** to follow in His steps?

>>>
+ Every day, **stressors** that challg: **project** not as plan
  + **Kids** / parents that don't do what I tell them
  + **Insulted**, belittled, or laughed at
+ No **choice** how others treat me, but choose how I **respond**
+ e.g., when young, single, **hot-headed**: stressed by **church**
  + Lined up reasons + verses **why** I'm right
  + Told mom I had **decision**: play hardball or soft
  + Mom **laughed** gently: why is it even a **question**?
+ If Jesus demonstrated that **humility** + submission
  + to God's plan is **stronger** than aggression

Out of my **distress** I called on the Lord;<br>

It is better to take **refuge** in the Lord<br>

I **thank** you that you have **answered** me<br>
and have become my **salvation**.

[Psalm 118:5,8,21 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Through history, children of **Israel** people of **suffering**
  + So when we are **afflicted**, opposed by enemies:
+ Follow example of **psalmist**:
  + **Call** on the Lord
  + Take **refuge** in Him alone
  + Give **thanks** for His rescue
+ So when the psalmist **returns** home,
  + he **enters** the city **gates** to worship:

---
Open to me the **gates of righteousness**,<br>
that I may enter through them<br>
and **give thanks** to the Lord.

[20](# "ref")
This is the **gate of the Lord**;<br>
the **righteous** shall enter through it.

[Psalm 118:19-20 (ESV)](# "ref")

+ This is the **gate** which Jesus now enters

**Save us**, we **pray**, O Lord!<br>
O Lord, we pray, give us **success**!

**Blessed** is he who comes <br>
in the **name** of the Lord!<br>
We bless you from the house of the Lord.

[Psalm 118:25-26 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Parallel structure: "We plead, Yahweh, **save** now!"
  + We plead, Yahweh, cause us to **advance** now!"
+ **Save** (hosanna): rescue (as from enemy / ext. threat)
  + Crowds literally calling out Jesus' **name**
+ **Success**: rush forward, advance (as army), prosper
+ Pair **plead** + **now**: implore, beseech, directed plea
  + earnest **request** from subord, not demand from entitle
+ **Directed**: to the only one who can save
  + with **assurance** bc what we've already seen Him do
+ So discip's **actions** in Lk19 fulfilled **prophecy** in Ps118
  + befit Jesus: **Saviour** to whom Hosanna is directed
  + the One who opens up the **gates** of righteousness
+ Acct in **John** indicates:

---
His disciples did **not understand** these things at first, <br>
but when Jesus was **glorified**, then they remembered  <br>
that these things had been **written** about him  <br>
and had been **done** to him.

[John 21:16 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ They were **unconscious prophets** (Alexander McLaren):
  + Acting in **obedience** in the moment
  + Only **later** realizing **signif** + honour of actions
+ So sometimes we **worship** God out of duty / habit (have to)
  + But in **hindsight** see eternal **import** of our praise
+ Cry out **Hosanna**: **direct** hope to Christ the Saviour
  + With **thanksgiving** for what He's already done
+ In what area do I need **rescue** today?
+ e.g., amidst **pandemic**: acknowledge feelings of **loss**:
  + **masks**, distancing, caring for **kids** at home
  + **shock** to system, adjustment of daily habits
+ How do I **cope**? Ignore issue? Mad/frust? Resign/depr?
+ Where do I **turn**? Cry out, "Hosanna!" to Lord: "Save!"
