# What do I have to **celebrate** about?

>>>
+ Do the celebrations of a group of **Israelites**
  + on the other side of the world, 2000 yrs ago
  + give **me** any reason to celeb now in 21st cent?
+ As we turn our attention off our own **complaints**
  + toward **Christ's** mighty acts of deliverance
+ Find the meaning of the word, "**Hosanna!**"
  + See the **power** of God manifest in our lives
  + Renewed **confidence** to testify to what God has done
+ Together, behold **Lamb of God**:

---
(prayer)
>>>
+ **Illuminate** our hearts w/**light** of Your truth
+ **Teach** us who You are, as Saviour, Redeemer, King
+ **Mould** us to walk in Your footsteps 
  + in **humility** + obedience
+ **Strengthen** us to proclaim boldly the witness of Your power

His disciples did **not understand** these things at first, <br>

that these things had been **written** about him  <br>
and had been **done** to him.

>>>
+ They were **unconscious prophets** (Alexander McLaren):
  + Acting in **obedience** in the moment

+ Cry out **Hosanna**: **direct** hope to Christ the Saviour
  + With **thanksgiving** for what He's already done
+ In what area do I need **rescue** today?

  + **masks**, distancing, caring for **kids** at home
